### Anubha Nagar's Projects

Hi everyone! Welcome to my GitHub page. My name is Anubha Nagar, and I recently graduated from my master's program at Vanderbilt University. During my time there, I specialized in data science, where I delved into the exciting world of data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP). Working closely with my friends and professors, I had the privilege to collaborate on numerous projects that allowed me to apply my skills and explore fascinating areas within the field. I'm truly grateful for the knowledge and experiences I gained through these projects.

To share my learnings and showcase the depth of each project, I've created this repository. Here, you'll find detailed presentations on each of the projects I worked on, providing comprehensive explanations and insights into the complexities tackled. From uncovering patterns in vast datasets to developing machine learning models and harnessing the power of NLP, these projects represent the culmination of my master's journey and the expertise I've acquired along the way.

I invite you to explore the various presentations, delve into the intricacies of the projects, and hopefully find inspiration or useful insights for your own data science endeavors. I'm excited to share my work with you, and I hope you find it informative and engaging. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there's anything I can assist you with. Happy exploring!
